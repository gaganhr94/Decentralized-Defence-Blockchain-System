# Decentralized-Defence-Blockchain-System
The project is a digital record of authorized suppliers and manufacturers. It tracks all transactions from raw materials procurement to the final finished product. It ensures military data is secure using authentication, hashing and mixers. It solves the inefficiencies in the manufacturing supply chain, eliminating counterfeit parts and weapons. 

# Run the Smart Contract 
1. Go to remix.ethereum.org
2. Defence_SupplyChain.sol has the Solidity code. Copy the file contents and paste it in the remix-ethereum platform editor
3. Compile the code 
4. Smart Contract is deployed for every weapon or military equipment 
5. Deploy the contract 
6. Once the smart contract is deployed, suppliers can be added to the weapon contract, subproduct/spare parts providers can be registered on the smart contract.
7. Ownership of spare parts can be transferred 

# Ethereum and Polygon
1. Gas fee for the transactions can be paid using Ethereum and Polygon testnets 
2. Metamask Browser extension can be used for this purpose
